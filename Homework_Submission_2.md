Homework Submission 2

# Lab Environment  
Lab has stayed the same for this submission. I had to fix an issue with GNS loosing its SSH keys due to the disk being wiped eash time it started.  

# Ansible
I'm slowly making progress. Just watching videos helps, but it's only when I spend time in the lab that it starts to make sense. Time constraints forced me to stop at the easiest option which was to create a simple [playbook](https://github.com/eoinwhite/ipSpaceCourse/blob/master/ansible/check-version.yml) using the lineinfile module to write the information into a [text file](https://github.com/eoinwhite/ipSpaceCourse/blob/master/ansible/version_report.txt)

# Workflow
I have updated my workflow. I have now started to learn VIM. This enables me to work on files from the NMS console and not rely on GIT to sync changes between text editors on my laptop and the NMS. I may try to get VMWare folder mapping working at a later date.
